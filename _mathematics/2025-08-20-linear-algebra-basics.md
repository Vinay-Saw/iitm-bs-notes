Linear algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics. Here we explore the concept of vectors and matrices.

## Vectors

A vector can be thought of as a quantity having both magnitude and direction. The dot product of two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is defined as:

$$
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \cos(\theta)
$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.

## Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers.

### The Identity Matrix
The identity matrix $I_n$ is a special $n \times n$ matrix that, when multiplied by another matrix, leaves it unchanged.

$$
I_n = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Euler's Identity
A famous equation involving complex numbers is Euler's Identity: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.
